So we now have a Websphere server which accepts and responds in serialized Java objects. Lets try a common-collections exploit on this one.

To read more about this exploit refer to:

This exploit requires two tools:

The tool ysoserial: A payloads generation tool for Java object deserialization bugs. Available online at https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial

An exploit in the form of a specific request which can exploit the vulnerability and deliver the payload. This is available at https://github.com/foxglovesec/JavaUnserializeExploits
